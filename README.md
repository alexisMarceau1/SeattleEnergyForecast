# SeattleEnergyForecast

This project aims to predict the energy consumption SiteEnergyUse(kBtu) and CO2 emissions TotalGHGEmissions of Seattle's non-residential buildings using 2015 and 2016 data.

In Seattle's context of aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050, this type of prediction would enable companies to reduce the costs associated with data collection while improving their ability to monitor and optimize the energy performance of their buildings.

We will also assess whether the ENERGYSTARScore, which is costly to calculate, can be omitted in emission predictions without compromising accuracy.

This project is divided into two notebooks:

1st notebook: notebook including data cleaning and EDA.
2nd notebook: notebook including different prediction models to best answer the problem.
