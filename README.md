# SeattleEnergyForecast

Project Overview
This project aims to predict the energy consumption (SiteEnergyUse(kBtu)) and CO₂ emissions (TotalGHGEmissions) of non-residential buildings in Seattle using data from 2015 and 2016. By forecasting these metrics, companies can identify opportunities to reduce energy costs and enhance the sustainability of their operations.

In alignment with Seattle's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, these predictions provide a means to optimize energy performance while minimizing data collection costs. Specifically, we investigate if omitting certain costly metrics like ENERGYSTARScore could still yield accurate predictions.
